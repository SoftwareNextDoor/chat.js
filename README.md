#Chat.js

## For end consumers

Welcome to Chat.js, a 100% javascript chat application. It runs on
NodeJs and EmberJs for the frontEnd, in the middle we have SockeIO for
real time events.

The goal of chat.js is to become a simple-access tool to chat on the
browser. I consider it insecure, but useful.


## For developers

What I can say right now, is that I want this proyect to have a good
design so that contributors can understand faster what this thing does.

I have reviewed othe similar projects, and the test suite is just one
file with wackamole inside. I'm not saying this is bad, but IMO is
harder to understand and extend. In other words, I feel they don't
embrace the extension of the project.
